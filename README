NAME
    PkgConfig::LibPkgConf - Interface to .pc file interface via libpkgconf

SYNOPSIS
     use PkgConfig::LibPkgConf;

DESCRIPTION
    Many libraries in compiled languages such as C or C++ provide ".pc"
    files to specify the flags required for compiling and linking against
    those libraries. Traditionally, the command line program "pkg-config" is
    used to query these files. This module provides a Perl level API using
    "libpkgconf" to these files.

SEE ALSO
    The best entry point to the low level "pkgconf" interface can be found
    via PkgConfig::LibPkgConf::Client.

    Alternatives include:

    PkgConfig
        Pure Perl implementation of "pkg-config" which can be used from the
        command line, or as an API from Perl. Does not require pkg-config in
        your path, so is a safe dependency for CPAN modules.

    ExtUtils::PkgConfig
        Wrapper for the "pkg-config" command line interface. This module
        will fail to install if "pkg-config" cannot be found in the "PATH",
        so it is not safe to use a dependency if you want your CPAN module
        to work on platforms where "pkg-config" is not installed.

    Alien::Base
        Provides tools for building non-Perl libraries and making them
        dependencies for your CPAN modules, even on platforms where the
        non-Perl libraries aren't arelady installed. Includes hooks for
        probing "pkg-config" ".pc" files using either "pkg-config" or
        PkgConfig.
