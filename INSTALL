This is the Perl distribution PkgConfig-LibPkgConf

You need to have pkgconf and libpkgconf installed on your system first.

Release tarballs for these can be found at:

https://distfiles.dereferenced.org/pkgconf/

If possible you should use the libpkgconf that comes with your system.  Note
that only newer version of pkgconf even come with libpkgconf!

Once unpacked, you install just like any other autoconf based project:

   % ./configure && make && make install

Once you have pkgconf and libpkgconf, installing PkgConfig-LibPkgConf is
straightforward.

## Installation with cpanm

If you have cpanm, you only need one line:

    % cpanm PkgConfig::LibPkgConf

If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to pass the
"-S" flag to cpanm, which uses sudo to install the module:

    % cpanm -S PkgConfig::LibPkgConf

## Installing with the CPAN shell

Alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to do:

    % cpan PkgConfig::LibPkgConf

## Manual installation

As a last resort, you can manually install it. Download the tarball, untar it,
then build it:

    % perl Build.PL
    % ./Build
    % ./Build test

Then install it:

    % ./Build install

If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to run:

    % sudo ./Build install

## Documentation

PkgConfig::LibPkgConf documentation is available as POD.
You can run perldoc from a shell to read the documentation:

    % perldoc PkgConfig::LibPkgConf
